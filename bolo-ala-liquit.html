  <h3>The italian classic! &#128525;</h3>
  <p>I've never been to the southern parts of Italy. And during the few times I've been in Tirol, Genova or Pisa, I didn't have the opportunity to try a genuine italian Bolognese. Since it was one of the first dishes I was able to cook though, this recipe comes with the refinement of a more than 25 years lasting quest for the best possible Bolgnese!</p>

  <p>Don't start with this recipe if you are hungry already! It will be on the stove for a couple of hours, so make sure your stomach isn't empty before you give it a go. Like a Lasagna, the Bolognese tends to taste even better the day after it was prepared!</p>

  <p>Final note: It is crucial to have fresh herbs at hand. The difference between 95ct dried stuff from the discounter of your choice and a handful of fresh herbs can't be emphasized enough! &#128523;</p>
