TOP HTML Foundations - Project: Recipes


This will be a simple website for recipes, consisting of one main page, that links to several recipe pages.

The goal is to solidify basic HTML, working with different headers, links, images and gaining a good feeling for a good layout and implementation of a solid file structure.
