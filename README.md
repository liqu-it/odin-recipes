TOP HTML Foundations - Project: Recipes


This will be a simple website for recipes, consisting of one main page, that links to several recipe pages.

The goal is to solidify basic HTML, working with different headers, links, images and gaining a good feeling for a good layout and implementation of a solid file structure. 

The project was picked up again in TOP - CSS Foundations. After learning the basic concepts of cascades, specifity, selectors and combinators, the goal is to add some color and style with the new learned abilites.

In the first step, some colors were added to the home page. 

In the second step, the header images were standardized, and the headline will appear in the color depneding on the sort of the dish. sub image will appear in the same color as headline, but slightly more opaque (yes, only to finally use a chaining selector!)
